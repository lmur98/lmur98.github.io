I am Lorenzo Mur-Labadia, a final-year PhD researcher in Deep Learning and Computer Vision at the University of Zaragoza (Spain), supervised by Prof. Rubén Martínez-Cantín and Prof. Josechu Guerrero.

My research focuses on video understanding, video–language learning, and 4D scene representations; with applications to embodied and egocentric perception. During my PhD, I developed visual models for segmentation, detection, forecasting, and representation learning, leading to eight first-author publications at top-tier computer vision venues, including ICRA 2023, ICCV 2023, IROS 2023, ECCV 2024, CVPR 2025, ICCV 2025 and 2 journals (CVIU and T-PAMI).

In the last 6 months, I was a Research Scientist intern at Meta AI (FAIR) in Paris, where I work with Adrien Bardes and Yann LeCun on the next generation of V-JEPA, a state-of-the-art architecture for large-scale self-supervised video understanding.
