I attended **CVPR 2024** in Seattle, presenting two winning solutions from the **Ego4D Challenge**: Bayesian temporal-order priors for test-time refinement, in collaboration with C. Plou., won **1st Prize** at the **EgoVIS Step Grounding Challenge** 
and *AFF-ttention! Affordances and Attention Models for Short-Term Object Interaction Anticipation* won **2nd Prize** at the **EgoVIS Short-Term Anticipation Challenge**.
